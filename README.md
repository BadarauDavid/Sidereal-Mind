# Sidereal-Mind

## Project Description 
The proposed project is a web application that integrates React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and NASA APIs to allow users to select a date from the past and discover details about NASA's events and images associated with that day. Additionally, the platform enables users to share their experiences with the site, like other experiences, and access breathing lessons and meditations for mental well-being.

### Technologies Used

In the development of Sidereal-Mind, we harnessed an array of technologies, each serving a vital role:


- JavaScript: Utilized to enhance the front-end with dynamic interactivity and creating a user-friendly interface;

- React: Renowned for its capacity to construct interactive and dynamic UI components, React served as our primary library for web application development.

- MongoDB: Acting as our primary database management system.

- Postman: Facilitated API testing and validation, ensuring the reliability and functionality of our APIs.

- Bootstrap and CSS: For creating impressive and responsive styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

- Node.js for back-end


### Chalanges

During development, we encountered a few challenges that managed to teach us important lessons, including:

- Sending data between components in React.

- GitHub Conflicts;

### Future Plans
Our future plans for Sidereal-Mind platform include:

- Let's restructure the StorySharing part

- Design restoration

- To add utility to : Music, Guided Meditation, Breathwork execises and Sacred Geometry
